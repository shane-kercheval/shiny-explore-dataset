# shiny-explore-dataset

Shiny Application for exploring new datasets.

## Hosted on shinyapps.io

The app is currently hosted at https://kercheval.shinyapps.io/shiny-explore-dataset/.

`shinyapps.io` gives a limited number of uptime hours per month at the free level, so it might be sporatically unavailable.

## Run Locally

This app utilitizes my [`rtools`](https://github.com/shane-kercheval/rtools) package which is a personal library of code that I typically re-use.

So, if you want to run locally, among the other libraries that are imported, you'll have to install `rtools` from github

```
devtools::install_github('shane-kercheval/rtools')
```


## Tidy Datasets

- this app expects tidy datasets
